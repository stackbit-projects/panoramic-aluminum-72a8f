With a little research on niche marketing, you will find
that the main issue when coming up with an idea is to pursue your
interests. Because if there is a lot of interest and excitement for the
subject, this desire to do the work and get the marketing activities done will

you will write a long list.

## Review from a marketing perspective

After preparing the list, in the next step, you should write
down various ideas and points from the marketing point of view. By doing

write them down somewhere. Write different ideas at the same time. It
is best to write down the tips at the beginning of the day and then add the
following to your notes.

each case, ask yourself the following questions.
